# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** ShaeelaHussain
**Date:** 2026-02-11

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Task Management App for learning teams to allocate, track, and manage tasks assigned to interns
**Goals:** Explore features, UX flows, differentiators, and technical approaches for an intern task management platform

### Context Guidance

_Loaded from project context template. Key exploration areas: User Problems & Pain Points, Feature Ideas & Capabilities, Technical Approaches, User Experience, Business Model & Value, Market Differentiation, Technical Risks & Challenges, Success Metrics._

### Session Setup

_ShaeelaHussain wants to build a task management platform where learning teams can assign and track work for interns. The app has two clear user roles — Team Leads/Mentors (allocators) and Interns (executors). The focus is on purpose-built intern management rather than adapting generic project management tools._

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Intern Task Management App with focus on features, UX flows, differentiators, and technical approaches

**Recommended Techniques:**

- **Role Playing:** Embody Team Leads and Interns to uncover pain points, workflows, and unmet needs from both perspectives
- **SCAMPER Method:** Systematically generate feature ideas by transforming existing task management tools through 7 creative lenses
- **Six Thinking Hats:** Evaluate best ideas through 6 perspectives (Facts, Emotions, Benefits, Risks, Creativity, Process) for validated prioritization

**AI Rationale:** The dual-role nature of this app (allocators vs executors) makes Role Playing ideal for foundation. SCAMPER leverages the familiar task management domain to find niche differentiators. Six Thinking Hats ensures rigorous validation before commitment.
